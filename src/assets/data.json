    "paragraph": "If you’re looking to optimize your conversion rate, case studies are a useful tool. Customers are often convinced by case studies that prove your products and solutions work. It’s important to show things like the value your business provides, sales history, and compare and contrast to your competitors’ solutions. Writing about a customer challenge and showing how your products solved that issue is a great technique to create your first case study."
